## Setup Instructions

1. `npm install` in the root
2. `cd pychatbot` and follow the instructions in that README
3. `npm run dev` to start frontend

I chose to put the backend and frontend in the same client in order to simplify setup, which is fine since there's not that much code anyway.

4. Once you've set up the backend, you can also use `npm run server` to run the backend from the root.
